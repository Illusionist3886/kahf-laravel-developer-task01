Why `area` field in `users` table are string rather than `area_id` from `areas` table. As `area ` name can be changed due to geo-political reason, if we issue a certificate upon vaccine receive, there will be mismatch with website data and printed vaccine certificate.

Same reason for `city` and `area` in `vaccine_centers` table.

Why `datalist` rather than beautiful `select2` or any other items?
For faster development and faster render on weak devices.
